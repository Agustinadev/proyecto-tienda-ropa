# Virtual shop with PHP (OOP-MVC), MYSQL and Javascript.

## IN PROCESS!

### Prugna is a clothing store that has a product section (soon organized into categories), a registration form and a login form. 

### The "normal" users can only edit their profile and log out while the "administrator" type has the additional ability to manage the products, they can add, delete or edit them.

### The website also uses the javascript pushbar library to make the menu pop out on the left with an animation.
